    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Just imagine a cute display of penguins, made with black olives, carrots and cream cheese! You can add scarves and hats by using fresh red pepper strips, or canned pimentos cut into different shapes. Use frilly toothpicks if you can.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients (for 18 servings)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>18 jumbo black olives, pitted</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>18 small black olives</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
    </ul>   
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1:</b>Cut a slit lengthwise (from top to bottom) into one side of each jumbo olive. Carefully insert about 1 teaspoon cream cheese into slits in each jumbo olive.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2:</b>Slice carrot into 18 1/4-inch-thick rounds; cut a small (pie-shaped) notch out of each carrot slice to form feet. Save the cut out pieces; press pieces into centers of small olives to form beaks. If necessary cut a small slit into each small olive before inserting the beak.</li>
        <li><b>Step 3:</b>Set a jumbo olive, large hole side down, onto a carrot slice. Then, set a small olive onto the jumbo olive, adjusting so that the beak, cream cheese chest, and notch in the carrot (feet) slice line up. Secure with a toothpick.</li>
    </ol>
